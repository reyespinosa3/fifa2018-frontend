## Movtivation

I've always enjoyed soccer, playing and watching. I played for +8 years as a teen/pre-teen and even playing on a company team. I've watched several of the FIFA World Cup Tournaments throughout the years and wanted to build an app around something I truly enjoy. Through my research, I also found that the only sites showing FIFA World Cup information were the Official FIFA.com site and the Associated Press site. Creating this site would provide a place my friends and other soccer fans could go to and get information about the Tournament and eventually incorporate a chat function to share highlights about our favorite teams, matches, players, goals, and more.
